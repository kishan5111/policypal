## Overview

Policy Pal is a web application that helps users understand lengthy terms and conditions documents without having to read them in full.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically extracts relevant content from web pages
- **Powerful AI Processing**: Leverages OpenAI's language models to analyze complex legal text
